        <p>SYRACUSE, NY-- "As we enter the holiday season, a lot of understanding this virus that has the potential to take out huge parts of the population goes into tracking spikes of highs and lows." Syracuse University Athletic Trainer, Andy Gomez.</p>
        <p>The first case of COVID-19 in New York State was confirmed by a positive test on March 1st, 2020. In the beginnings of the COVID-19 pandemic, many New York residents continuously followed the number of cases in an effort to keep up the spread of the pandemic in their state.</p>
        <p>Following a nation-wide shutdown and the Trump Administration declaring the United States in a national emergency, it was essential that New York residents were proactive about following the spread of COVID-19. It is no secret that in the midst of the pandemic’s “peak,” many New York residents checked the rise of positive cases consistently out of fear, however, as time has gone on, the talk surrounding COVID-19 has slowly diminished.</p>
        <p>With the fear surrounding the pandemic beginning to slow down, the public’s interest in tracking the pandemic has also slowed down in unison. The reality of the pandemic’s state today is that each county in New York state is continuing to see positive COVID-19 test results daily.</p>
        <p>In an effort to keep citizens updated and involved with new information on the COVID-19 pandemic, New York state has continued to share the numbers of positive COVID-19 tests through their <a href="https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/New-York-State-Statewide-COVID-19-Testing/xdss-u53e">official website</a>. The website includes a data set facilitated by the New York State Department of Health that is titled, “New York State Statewide COVID-19 Testing” which contains information on the number of tests of individuals for COVID-19 in New York State beginning on March 1, 2020.</p>
        <p>According to the New York State Department of Health, their primary goal in publishing the data set was, “to provide users timely information about local disease spread and reporting of positive cases.”</p>
        <p>The data set has been updated daily to show tests completed by midnight the day of the update. The data set is broken up by the test date, the county in which the test took place, the number of new positive tests, the cumulative number of positive tests, the total number of tests performed that day, the cumulative number of test performed, the test percentage that is positive, and whether or not the data was collected in a county or the data was collected in a region.</p>
        <p> According to Syracuse University Athletic Trainer, Julie Wonch, she tells her collegiate athletes to test for COVID-19 as soon as they begin having symptoms. She says that while we see viruses such as the flu year round, we can anticipate that it has a season with higher spikes. She stresses to her athletes that as of right now, we don’t know what the COVID season is, and with the disease having a lasting impact on a lot of people, “it is important for us to keep track of those numbers.”</p> 
        <p>Her partner, Andy Gomez, agreed that COVID-19 could be like the flu where we see many different strains, and in turn greatly impact the human population and have long lasting effects on society.</p>
        <p>In the bar chart made from the data set, the top five counties with the highest average percentage of positive COVID-19 tests in 2020, the pandemic’s first year, occurred in Queens, Rockland, Bronx, Kings, and Nassau.</p>
        <p>Queens had the most positive COVID-19 tests, with a percentage of 2854.29% positive tests. Rockland had the next highest percentage of positive COVID-19 tests with 2833.84%. Bronx had the third highest percentage of positive COVID-19 tests with 2719.25%. Kings had the fourth highest percentage of positive COVID-19 tests with 2709.43%. Nassau had the fifth highest percentage of positive COVID-19 tests with 2665.38%.</p>

        <p>In the map of the percentage of positive tests  by county in New York State in 2021, the top five counties were Fulton, Montgomery, Chautauqua, Oswego, and Niagara.</p>
        <p>The county with the highest percentage of positive COVID-19 tests was Fulton, with 5796.42%. The county with the second highest percentage of positive COVID-19 tests was Montgomery, with  5590.64%.

        <p>In the column chart demonstrating the cumulative number of positive COVID-19 tests from March 1, 2020 until October 19, 2022, the counties with the most positive tests were Kings, Queens, Suffolk, Nassau, and New York.</p>
        <p> The county with the highest number of cumulative positive COVID-19 tests was Kings with 346,351.14 tests. The county with the second highest number of cumulative positive COVID-19 tests was Queens with 329,487.07 tests. The county with the third highest number of cumulative positive COVID-19 tests was Suffolk with 228,838.05 tests. The county with the fourth highest number of cumulative positive COVID-19 tests was Nassau with 215,683.17 tests. The county with the fifth highest number of cumulative positive COVID-19 tests was New York with 200,788.72 tests.</p>

        <p>The comparison between these three data sets is notable given that there was an overlap between Kings county and Queens county. Both counties were in the top five counties in New York State with the average percentage of positive COVID-19 tests in the pandemics first year, 2020, as well as the overall cumulative number of positive COVID-19 tests from the start of the pandemic until October 19, 2022.  This analysis is important as it emphasizes the importance of New York residents following the rise of positive COVID-19 cases both in and around these counties. With these counties continuously landing at the top of the data set, it is especially crucial that citizens are tracking these numbers consistently in order to ensure that they are aware if the numbers of positive COVID-19 tests rise significantly in their county. Without continuously following these case numbers, citizens are not able to keep up with the spread of the pandemic at the local level.</p>
        <p>While there has been a lack of recognition regarding the importance of following COVID-19 data since it has been almost three years since the Trump Administration declared the United States in the state of a national emergency and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the spread of COVID-19 as a Global Pandemic, it is imperative that citizens continue to follow the rise in COVID-19 cases. It is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic escalated exponentially quickly and before the world’s eyes 2020; therefore, it is likely that if the numbers began to rise again the virus could easily spread like a wildfire, as it did the first time.</p>
        <p>As much as society would hope that the pandemic would just disappear, the daily state of the pandemic shown in the data three years later is continuing to reveal that each county in New York state is still seeing positive COVID-19 test results daily. With the data proving that the virus is not projected to leave New York state in the near future, it is imperative to be knowledgeable on these numbers</p>
        <p>The best way to stay continuously aware of the state of your local area is to be diligent about tracking these numbers through ofically websites run by <a href="https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/home"> The New York State Department of Health</a>, in order to react effectively with caution when you see a substantial increase in the number of positive COVID-19 cases in your area.</p>
